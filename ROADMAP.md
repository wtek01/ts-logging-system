# üöÄ Roadmap: Microservices Logging System

## **Version 1.0 (MVP) - Basic Logging System**

‚úÖ Implement a **logging service** with Express & Winston
‚úÖ Microservices (Auth, Payment, Order) send logs via HTTP
‚úÖ Store logs in files (`logs/app.log`)

## **Version 2.0 - Scalable Log Processing**

‚¨ú Integrate **Redis/Kafka** for log queuing
‚¨ú Implement **log processing workers** for async storage
‚¨ú Add **log filtering & structured JSON format**
‚úÖ Implement a queue system (Redis Streams or Kafka) to handle logs asynchronously.
‚úÖ Process logs in background workers instead of writing immediately.
‚úÖ Enhance log structure (include metadata like request ID, user ID, etc.).
‚úÖ Support log filtering (e.g., only store logs above a certain severity level).
üìå Breakdown of the Log Flow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Microservices (Auth, Payment, Order) send logs ‚Üí Redis stores them in logs-stream.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Worker (logWorker.ts) listens to logs-stream and reads logs asynchronously.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Worker processes logs:

- If log level is warn or error, store it in logs/app.log.
- (Future) Store logs in Elasticsearch for real-time search. 4Ô∏è‚É£ After processing, logs are deleted from Redis (xdel).

## **Version 3.0 - Advanced Storage & Search**

‚¨ú Store logs in **Elasticsearch for real-time search**
‚¨ú Implement **log querying API** (GET /logs with filters)
‚¨ú Support **log retention policies**

## **Version 4.0 - Monitoring & Visualization**

‚¨ú Integrate **Grafana/Kibana for dashboard visualization**
‚¨ú Implement **alerting mechanisms** for critical errors
‚¨ú Add **role-based access control (RBAC)** for logs

## **Version 5.0 - Deployment & Scalability**

‚¨ú Deploy microservices using **Docker & Kubernetes**
‚¨ú Implement **rate-limiting & security best practices**
‚¨ú Optimize performance for **high-throughput logging**
